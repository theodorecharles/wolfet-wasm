# wolfet-wasm-owned assets

The short announcer clips under `etjs/sound/announcer/` were generated for this
project from synthesized speech and normalized as mono WAV files. They are not
ripped from Unreal Tournament, ETPub, ETLegacy, or the original Wolfenstein:
Enemy Territory data.

`npm run build:pak` packages the `etjs/` subtree as ignored
`runtime/legacy/etjs.pk3`, keeping these project-owned additions separate from
the official game archives.

The public image never includes Unreal Tournament audio. An operator who owns
UT2004 may put locally extracted `doublekill.wav`, `multikill.wav`,
`megakill.wav`, `ultrakill.wav`, and `monsterkill.wav` files in
`/data/announcer/`. On startup the container replaces the generated fallback
clips in its private ETJS overlay without modifying the UT2004 installation.
